## Buddy system
- The buddy system is a simple dynamic storage allocation method. The buddy system is a memory allocation and management algorithm that manages memory in power of two increments.

## Advantages 
- Easy to implement a buddy system
- Allocates block of correct size 
- It is easy to merge adjacent holes
- Fast to allocate memory and de-allocating memory

## Disadvantages
- It requires all allocation unit to be power of two 
- It leads to internal fragmentation
- Merging of holes is recursive, so poor worst-case behavior
