## Memory management
- Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.

## Function of Memory management 
- Allocate primary memory space to processes
- Minimize access time
- Determining allocation policy for memory
- Deallocation technique and policy

## Address space Mapping

- The Address Binding refers to the mapping of computer instructions and data to physical memory locations. Both logical and physical addresses are used in computer memory. It assigns a physical memory region to a logical pointer by mapping a physical address to a logical address known as a virtual address. It is also a component of computer memory management that the OS performs on behalf of applications that require memory access.

‚è∫ Compile Time Address Binding
- It is the first type of address binding. It occurs when the compiler is responsible for performing address binding, and the compiler interacts with the operating system to perform the address binding. In other words, when a program is executed, it allocates memory to the system code of the computer. The address binding assigns a logical address to the beginning of the memory segment to store the object code. Memory allocation is a long-term process and may only be modified by recompiling the program.

‚è∫ Load Time Address Binding
- It is another type of address binding. It is done after loading the program in the memory, and it would be done by the operating system memory manager, i.e., loader. If memory allocation is specified when the program is assigned, no program in its compiled state may ever be transferred from one computer to another. Memory allocations in the executable code may already be in use by another program on the new system. In this case, the logical addresses of the program are not connected to physical addresses until it is applied and loaded into memory.

‚è∫ Execution Time or Dynamic Address Binding
- Execution time address binding is the most popular type of binding for scripts that aren't compiled because it only applies to variables in the program. When a variable in a program is encountered during the processing of instructions in a script, the program seeks memory space for that variable. The memory would assign the space to that variable until the program sequence finished or unless a specific instruction within the script released the memory address connected to a variable.
