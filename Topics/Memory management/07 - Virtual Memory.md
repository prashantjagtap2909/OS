## Virtual Memory

- It is a space where large programs can access themselves in form of pages while their execution and only the regional pages or position of processes are loaded into the main memory. This technique is very useful as large virtual memory is provided for user programs when a very small memory is there.

### Advantages 
 - Large programs can be written,as virtual space available is huge compared to physical memory.
 - Less I/O required leads to faster and easy swapping of processes.
 - More physical memory available as programs are stored on virtual memory so they occupy very less space on actual physical memory.
