## Threads :- 
          - A thread is a path of exexution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads. It is also known as light weight process.
          
### Thread lifecycle

🛑 New 
    - Thread is just created.
    
🛑 Ready 
    - Thread's start() method invoked and now it is executing OS put thread into ready state.
    
🛑 Running 
    - Highest priority ready thread enters the running state. Thread is assigned a processor and now is running.
    
🛑 Blocked 
    - This is the state when a thread is waiting for a lock to access the object.
    
🛑 Waiting 
    - Here thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform an action
    
🛑 Sleeping
    - Thread sleep for a specified time of period. When sleeping time expires, it enters to ready state. CPU is not used by sleeping thread.
    
🛑 Dead 
    - When thread completes task or operation

## Advantages-
          - *️⃣ Thread minimize the context switching time 
          - *️⃣ User of threads provide concurrency with a process
          - *️⃣ Efficient communication
          - *️⃣ It is more economical to create a context switch thread
          - *️⃣ Threads allow utilization of multiprocessor architectures to a greater scale and efficiently

## Types of Threads:-
          🛑 User level thread
          🛑 kernal level thread
