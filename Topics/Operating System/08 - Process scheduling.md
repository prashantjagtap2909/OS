## Process scheduling
- The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

- Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.


### Types of scheduling
 
 ðŸ›‘ Non-preemptive: Here the resource canâ€™t be taken from a process until the process completes execution. The switching of resources occurs when the running process terminates and moves to a waiting state.
 
 ðŸ›‘ Preemptive: Here the OS allocates the resources to a process for a fixed amount of time. During resource allocation, the process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. This switching occurs as the CPU may give priority to other processes and replace the process with higher priority with the running process.


### Process scheduling queues

he OS maintains all Process Control Blocks (PCBs) in Process Scheduling Queues. The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. When the state of a process is changed, its PCB is unlinked from its current queue and moved to its new state queue.



Job queue 
  âˆ’ This queue keeps all the processes in the system.

Ready queue 
  âˆ’ This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new process is always put in this queue.

Device queues
  âˆ’ The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device constitute this queue.
