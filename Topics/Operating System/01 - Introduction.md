## Introduction

 Operating System :- An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs. It is an interrface between application and hardware.
 it also can be defined as program that manages the computer hardware.
 
 It also provides a basis for application program and acts as intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.
 
 ## Unix Opearating System 
 - Developed in 1969 and now owned by open group.
 - It is command line interface (CLI) based operating system
 - Built in security but there is must need to install the updates manually
 - Built on an open standard, but single unix specification provides a standard and ensure continuity across different distribution of UNIX
 - It has a steep learning curve
 
 
 ## Window Operating System 
 - Originally released in 1985
 - Graphical user interface (GUI) based operating System 
 - Compatible with thousands of application and utilities
 - Updates and fixes can be downloaded and installed automatically 
 - Huge support community
 - The code is proprietary owned by Microsoft
 
 
### Function of Operating System
   - 1 User Convenience : User convenience is affected by computing enviroment of the computer system. The computing environment is comprised of computer system, item interface with othersystem and nature of computations performed by its user.
                       - Computer architecture and use change the computing environment of the system.
  - 2 Efficient use : For efficient use of resources, it must be monitored by operating system. Proper scheduling of resources is also required.
                      - Computer contains differen types of resources like CPU, memory and I/O device etc. Proper monitoring is required on these resources to avoid the overhead. As per the resource, scheduling is required.
  - 3 Ability to evolve : An OS should be construced in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions without at the same time interfacing with service.
