## Multithreading

‚è∫ The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. 

‚è∫ Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies of the program running on the computer. Multithreading can also handle multiple requests from the same user.

‚è∫ Each user request for a program or system service is tracked as a thread with a separate identity. As programs work on behalf of the initial thread request and are interrupted by other requests, the work status of the initial request is tracked until the work is completed. In this context, a user can also be another program.

‚è∫ Fast central processing unit (CPU) speed and large memory capacities are needed for multithreading. The single processor executes pieces, or threads, of various programs so fast, it appears the computer is handling multiple requests simultaneously.


## Multithreading Model
There exists three established multithreading models classifying these relationships are:

üõë Many to one multithreading model

üõë One to one multithreading model

üõë Many to Many multithreading models


   Many to one multithreading model:
- The many to one model maps many user levels threads to one kernel thread. This type of relationship facilitates an effective context-switching environment, easily implemented even on the simple kernel with no thread support.

- The disadvantage of this model is that since there is only one kernel-level thread schedule at any given time, this model cannot take advantage of the hardware acceleration offered by multithreaded processes or multi-processor systems. In this, all the thread management is done in the userspace. If blocking comes, this model blocks the whole system.

 One to one multithreading model:
- The one-to-one model maps a single user-level thread to a single kernel-level thread. This type of relationship facilitates the running of multiple threads in parallel. However, this benefit comes with its drawback. The generation of every new user thread must include creating a corresponding kernel thread causing an overhead, which can hinder the performance of the parent process. Windows series and Linux operating systems try to tackle this problem by limiting the growth of the thread count.

 Many to Many Model multithreading model:
- In this type of model, there are several user-level threads and several kernel-level threads. The number of kernel threads created depends upon a particular application. The developer can create as many threads at both levels but may not be the same. The many to many model is a compromise between the other two models. In this model, if any thread makes a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another thread for execution. Also, with the introduction of multiple threads, complexity is not present as in the previous models. Though this model allows the creation of multiple kernel threads, true concurrency cannot be achieved by this model. This is because the kernel can schedule only one process at a time.
