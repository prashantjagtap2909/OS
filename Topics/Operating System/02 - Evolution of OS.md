# Evolution of Operating System

## Generations of Operating System :- 
- a First Generation (1945 - 1955)
      Vaccum tubes and plug record
      
- b Second Generation (1955 - 1965)
        Transistors and Batch record 
        
- c Third Generation (1965 - 1980)
        Integrated circuit and multi programming
        
- d Forth Generation ( 1980 - current)
        Personal computer 
        
       
       
## Types of Opearating System :- 
 
   üõë Batch Operating System - The user of this OS not interact with the computer directly each user prepares this job with similar on an offline device called punch card and submit to computer operator.

     *Ô∏è‚É£ Avantages :- 1. No interaction between user and computer
                     2. No mechanism to provide the process
                     
     *Ô∏è‚É£ Disadvantages :- 1. Lack of interaction between user and job
                         2. CPU is often idle because the speed of I/O mechanical device is slower than I/O.
                         3. Difficult to provide desired priority
                       
                     
  üõë Time Sharing Operating System - It is a technique which enable many user located at varios terminals to use particular computer system at the same time processor's time is simultaneously shared among multi-user is termed as time sharing.
  
    *Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages :- 1. Quick responce
                     2. Avoids duplication of software
                     3. Reduce CPU idle time
                     
    *Ô∏è‚É£ Disadvantages :- 1. Problem of reliability
                         2. Problem of data communication
                         
                   
  üõë Distributed operating system - It uses multiple processors to serve multiple real time applications and multiple user. Data processing jobs are distribured among the processor recording
   
    *Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages :- 1. Better service to the customer 
                      2. Reduction of load on the host computer
                      3. Reduction of delays in data processing 
                      4. Speedup the exchange of data with one another via electronic mail
                      5. Incremental growth
                      6. Resource sharing 
                      
     *Ô∏è‚É£ Disadvantages :- 1. Security
    
    
   üõë Real time operating system - The real time operating system is system in which gaurentees the maximum time for critical operations and compile them on time.
    
      *Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages :- 1. Ideal for processing a large amount of data
                      2. Information is always up-to-date
                      3. Insights are immediately available from the updated data
                        
      *Ô∏è‚É£ Disadvantages:- 1. Requires a complicated and expensive system
                        2. Tedious to process
                        3. Difficult for auditing
                        
                       
   üõë Network operating system - The network os runs on a server and provide the server capability to manage data, user groups, security, applications and other networking function
    
      *Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages:- 1. Highly stable contralized server
                      2. Security concern are handled through server
                      3. New technologies and hardware upgradation are easily integrated to the system
                      4. Server access are possible remotely from different location and type of system
                      
      *Ô∏è‚É£ Disadvantages :- 1. Servers are costly
                          2. Maintainance and update requires regularly
