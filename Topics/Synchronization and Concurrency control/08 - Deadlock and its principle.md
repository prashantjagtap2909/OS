## Deadlock 
- Deadlock can be defined as the permanent blocking of a set of processes that either complete for system resources. Deadlock can occur on sharable resources.

#### Condition required for Deadlock to exist

  ⏺ Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can use a resource at any given time i.e. the resources are non-sharable.
  
  ⏺ Hold and wait: A process is holding at least one resource at a time and is waiting to acquire other resources held by some other process.
  
  ⏺ No preemption: The resource can be released by a process voluntarily i.e. after execution of the process.
  
  ⏺ Circular wait: A circular chain of hold and wait condition exists in the system.
