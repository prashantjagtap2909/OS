## Deadlock prevention

- There are four necessary conditions for deadlock. Deadlock happens only when all four conditions occur simultaneously for unshareable single instance resources.
- To prevent a deadlock the os must eliminate one of the these four conditions.

♦ The conditions for deadlock are:

⏺ Mutual exclusion
⏺ Hold and wait
⏺ No preemption
⏺ Circular wait.

🛑 1. Mutual exclusion:- It is necessary in any computer system because some resources must be exclusively allocated to one user at a time. No other process can use a resource while it is allocated to a process.


🛑 2. Hold and wait:- If a process holding certain resources is denied a further request, it must release its original resources and if required request them again.

🛑 3. No preemption:- It could be bypassed by allowing the operating system to deallocate resources from process.

🛑4. Circular wait:- Circular wait can be bypassed if the operating system prevents the formation of a circle.
